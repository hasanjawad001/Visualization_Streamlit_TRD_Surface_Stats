# Surface Statistics Analysis

This project provides a tool for visualizing and analyzing surface statistics data related to my internship at Toyota Racing Development for motorsport applications. The code uses Streamlit for building an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore univariate and bivariate relationships between surface characteristics.

### Features
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Visualizes relationships between selected surface metrics using scatter plots with adjustable axis ranges.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Displays bar charts with error bars to examine mean and standard deviations of selected surface metrics over time and tracks.
- The visualizations are generated using Plotly for interactive exploration, with data filtered by year, track, and measurement type.

Simply upload your data in the required JSON format, and adjust the visual settings to gain insights into the surface performance metrics across various conditions.

### Privacy Note
For privacy and confidentiality reasons, the actual data used has been excluded from this repository.
